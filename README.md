## Description
This is an application to enable people market themseleves and their work on a simple easy to use platform. With this, they will be able to find market for themselves and also people or ordinary users looking for their specialties will be able to find them here. Users will be able to search for any profession they might be interested in and they will be provided with suggestion within a 5km radius (or larger) for the available service providers. Professionals will be able to grow their profile basing on a system of ratings and reviews as higher profile professionals will be given higher priority over lower priority ones in an attempt to provide users with quality options.
Once a user finds a professional they are interested in, they will be able to submit a formal job request to the professional. The professional has the ability to accept or decline the request at their own will.
The user and professional can also chat with our in built chat and text feature. Afterwards, a user can give the professional a rating basing on the work they have done and even provide a review for future customers to base on while contacting said professional.
Professional, upon completion of 20 tasks with various clients, will attain verification status. When a professional meets with a client, he/she is required to display a QR code embedded with their details to the client to prove/verify that indeed, he is the one they requested for.
